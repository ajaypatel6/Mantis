# Mantis Plagiarism Detection
The Mantis has capability of detecting plagiarism between up to 3 different programming languages. Meaning, converting a java code to a C code will be considered plagiarism as well. 

# How?

Teachers upload their class set of codes to the system, the files are cleaned and tokenized

The tokenizated strings are compared between assignments

Using 3-grams method we detect and seperate the strings to find commonality within the code intermediates
