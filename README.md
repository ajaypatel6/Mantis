The Mantis has capability of detecting plagiarism between up to 3 different programming languages. Meaning, converting a java code to a C code will be considered plagiarism as well.

Teachers upload their class set of codes to the system, the files are cleaned and tokenized

The tokenizated strings are compared between assignments

Using 3-grams method we detect and seperate the strings to find commonality within the code intermediates

More information is fully documented in the SRS
